# 🏓 pong-ai-test 🤖

Welcome to pong-ai-test, a modern twist on the classic Pong game, developed with the help of GitHub's AI, CoPilot.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser by downloading the project and opening the `index.html` file.
2. Use the `W` and `S` keys to move the left paddle up and down.
3. Use the `Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow` keys to move the right paddle up and down.
4. The goal is to hit the ball with your paddle and send it to your opponent's side. If the ball reaches the edge of your opponent's side, you score a point!
5. The game ends when a player reaches a score of 10.

## 🕹️ Game Mechanics

- The ball speeds up every time it hits a paddle.
- The direction the ball moves in depends on where it hits the paddle.
- The game dynamically adjusts to the size of the browser window.
- The game features a net in the middle of the canvas.
- The game features a star animation that appears when a player scores a point.

## 💻 Development

This game was developed using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API for rendering. The development process was guided by GitHub's AI, CoPilot, which provided code suggestions and solutions to problems encountered during development.

The game features include dynamic resizing, collision detection, scoring, sound effects, and (planned) AI-assisted paddle movement. The AI for the paddle will use a simple heuristic: if the ball is above the paddle, it moves up, and if the ball is below the paddle, it moves down.

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add a start/pause button to control the game flow.
- Add a reset button to restart the game.
- Add an option to play against an AI opponent.
- Add different difficulty levels for the AI opponent.
- Add more sound effects for different game events.
